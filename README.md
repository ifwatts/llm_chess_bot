- **Loading Spinner**: Visual feedback during computer thinking time
- **Game Over Overlay**: Elegant end-game notifications for checkmate/stalemate
- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for desktop viewing with mobile considerations

### Technical Features
- **Containerized Deployment**: Easy setup with Podman/Docker
- **RESTful API**: Clean separation between frontend and backend
- **Chess Engine**: Powered by python-chess library for legal move validation
- **Skill Tuning System**: Multi-layered difficulty adjustment using prompt engineering, temperature control, and move filtering

## Requirements

- **Container Runtime**: Podman or Docker
- **Compose Tool**: Podman Compose or Docker Compose
- **Web Browser**: Modern browser with JavaScript enabled (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llm_chess_bot.git
cd llm_chess_bot
```

### 2. Build and Deploy

**Using Podman (Recommended):**
```bash
# Build the containers
podman-compose build

# Start the services
podman-compose up -d

# Check container status
podman-compose ps
```

**Using Docker:**
```bash
# Build the containers
docker-compose build

# Start the services
docker-compose up -d

# Check container status
docker-compose ps
```

### 3. Automatic Model Download

The llama2 model (approximately 3.8GB) will be automatically downloaded on first startup. This may take several minutes depending on your internet connection. You can monitor the download progress:

```bash
# For Podman
podman logs -f llm_chess_bot_ollama_1

# For Docker
docker logs -f llm_chess_bot_ollama_1
```

Wait until you see "Ollama is ready!" in the logs before proceeding.

### 4. Access the Application

Open your web browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5001
```

You should see the chess board ready to play!

## How to Play

1. **Start a Game**: The board loads with white pieces at the bottom (your side)
2. **Make a Move**: Click a piece to select it, then click the destination square
3. **AI Response**: The computer will think and make its move (watch for the blue flash!)
4. **Adjust Difficulty**: Use the skill level slider (1-10) at any time to change AI strength
5. **View History**: Check the right panel to see all moves with piece names
6. **Reset Game**: Click the "Reset Game" button to start over

### Skill Levels Explained

| Level | Description | Characteristics |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1-2 | Beginner | Random moves, frequent mistakes, 50% chance of random move |
| 3-4 | Learning | Basic tactics, occasional blunders, 35% chance of random move |
| 5-6 | Intermediate | Considers tactics and piece activity, 20% chance of random move |
| 7-8 | Advanced | Strong tactical and positional play, 10% chance of random move |
| 9 | Expert | Complex evaluations, 5% chance of random move |
| 10 | Master | Objectively best moves, full LLM strength |

## Rebuilding and Redeploying

If you make changes to the code, rebuild and redeploy:

```bash
# Stop containers
podman-compose down

# Rebuild with no cache
podman-compose build --no-cache chess-app

# Start containers
podman-compose up -d
```

## Manual Setup (Without Containers)

If you prefer to run without containers (note: automated model download only works with containerized deployment):

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Install Ollama
Download and install Ollama from [https://ollama.ai/](https://ollama.ai/)

### 3. Pull the Model
```bash
ollama pull llama2
```

### 4. Run the Application
```bash
# Set port (optional, defaults to 5000)
export PORT=5001

# Start Flask server
python app.py
```

### 5. Access
Navigate to `http://localhost:5001` in your browser

## Configuration

### Changing the LLM Model

Edit [player.py](player.py:22) to use a different Ollama model:

```python
self.model = "llama2"  # Change to another model (e.g., "mistral", "codellama")
```

Available models: [Ollama Library](https://ollama.ai/library)

### Changing the Default Skill Level

Edit [app.py](app.py:14) to set a different starting skill level:

```python
DEFAULT_SKILL_LEVEL = 5  # Change to 1-10
```

### Changing the Port

Edit [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) to change the exposed port:

```yaml
ports:
  - "5001:5000"  # Change 5001 to your preferred port
```

Or set the PORT environment variable:

```bash
export PORT=8080
python app.py
```

## Testing

The application includes a comprehensive test suite:

### Run Tests
```bash
# Ensure app is running on port 5001
python run_tests.py
```

### Test Coverage
- Basic opening moves validation
- Board state verification
- Pawn promotion mechanics
- Move legality checks

### Writing New Tests
Add test cases to [test_chess.py](test_chess.py):

```python
def test_my_scenario(self):
    """Test description"""
    # Make moves in test mode
    response = self.make_move("e2e4", test_mode=True)
    # Assert board state
    self.assertEqual(response['turn'], 'black')
```

## Troubleshooting

### Application Won't Start
- **Check containers**: `podman-compose ps` or `docker-compose ps`
- **View logs**: `podman-compose logs` or `docker-compose logs`
- **Port conflict**: Ensure port 5001 is not in use

### Can't Connect to Ollama
- **Check Ollama container**: `podman logs llm_chess_bot_ollama_1`
- **Verify model**: `podman exec -it llm_chess_bot_ollama_1 ollama list`
- **Restart containers**: `podman-compose restart`

### AI Moves Are Slow
- LLM processing takes 3-10 seconds per move (normal behavior)
- First moves may be slower due to model initialization
- Consider using a faster model like "mistral" for quicker responses

### Board Not Displaying
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors (F12)
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled
- Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Clear browser cache

### Tests Failing
- Ensure app is running on port 5001
- Check that the board state matches expected values
- Verify test mode is enabled in move requests

## Development

### Making UI Changes

1. Edit [style.css](style.css), [index.html](index.html), or [chess.js](chess.js)
2. Rebuild: `podman-compose build --no-cache chess-app`
3. Restart: `podman-compose up -d`
4. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Making Backend Changes

1. Edit [app.py](app.py), [board.py](board.py), or [player.py](player.py)
2. Rebuild and restart (same as UI changes)
3. Check logs: `podman-compose logs chess-app`

### Git Workflow
